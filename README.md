# FROM START-UP TO STAYING POWER:
## How Square Inc Became an Ecosystem of Necessity

### Overview and Origin
---
Jim McKelvey had, in his mind, just secured sale of his artwork for two thousand dollars. 
When Jim met with the buyer, the buyer did not have nearly enough cash to pay for the transaction 
and Jim was not able to accept the buyer’s credit card. 
From this interaction, Square Incorporated was conceived. 
Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey are the founders of Square Inc and the company incorporated in June 2009. 
Before going public the company went through seven rounds of private funding. 
Investors included Acequia Capital, Sequoia Capital and Kholsa Partners. 
Jack Dorsey led the company through its Initial Public Offering in November of 2015. 
The IPO price was $9, and Square ended its first day of trading at $13.07. 

### Business Activities
---
Square allows any merchant or vendor, however small, to accept electronic payments. 
It also provides small business the ability to electronically collect funds from customers. 
This innovation came in the form of its Square Reader in 2009 and allowed credit cards to be swiped anywhere 
a seller had a smart phone and internet connection. 
This type of access into the economy allowed all types of businesses to prosper by cutting barriers for new and existing businesses. 
Square also created the Cash App for IOS and Android devices. 
Square is one of the early adopters of mobile transfers and holds a sizable market share of mobile funds transfers between consumers. Square has simplified the process of exchanging funds between parties by providing essential software and hardware products to small business. When questioned about Square’s business model by B2B News at a conference in Toronto, Jack Dorsey replied, “We’re not just payments or POS but a suite of tools to help our sellers. The first critical thing was to enable sellers to make the sale. Then it was organizing the information to make more sales.”

After the successful launch of its Square Reader, the company introduced Square Register. 
Square Register combines POS hardware, software and payment processing in a sleek and modern design. 
They also offer other hardware at various price points to ensure that Square is within reach to any size business. 
Because of the many hardware and software combinations and its flat fee for processing payments from any major credit card carrier, 
Square Inc’s major advantage is its ecosystem of hardware and software. Square Capital is one of the company’s newest ventures. 
Square Capital lends funds to small business and using its data from its payment processing, 
Square Capital will determine the amount to loan a business. 
The loan is then paid back daily from a percentage of the daily card sales of the business. 

Employee Zach Brock of Square Inc writes, 
“The backend services are written in Ruby and Java. On the Java side, 
we have developed our own service framework that has built-in logging, metrics, RPC, containerization, etc. built on top of
well-known Open Source tools.” 
He also states the company uses Postgres, MySQL, HDFS and log files for storing data. 
On StackShare.Io, Square lists 23 applications and programming languages and 12 DevOps tools 
among the technology implemented by the company. 

The targeted customer base is focused toward small business and individual consumers. 
Small business clients drive the revenue for Square, so it is important for Square to be in tune with the needs
and economics of small businesses. 
Data from JP Morgan Chase and Co. shows in 2010 small business accounted for 45% of U.S. gross domestic product 
and in 2014, employed 48% of U.S. workforce.

### Landscape
---
The domain of payment processing has been consistently evolving with innovative technology. 
The credit card was introduced in the 1950s, and the debit card came to market in the 1970s. 
Encyclopedia.Com states “In the mid-1990s the use of debit cards began growing at an exponential rate. 
In 2003 the number of electronic-payment transactions (debit cards and credit cards together) 
surpassed the number of paper check transactions in the United States for the first time.” 
Europay, Mastercard and Visa started a joint venture to install more security measures in credit and debit cards using chip technology. 
EMV Technology made its debut in 1994. Although America would not make it a requirement for U.S. Merchants until 2015, 
the technology was more quickly adopted by the rest of the world. 
One of the newest forms of payment gaining traction in America is contactless payment. 
Investopedia tells us that contactless payment technology was invented in the 1990s 
with Google and Android creating pay systems to go along with their devices in 2011, and Apple introducing Apple Pay in 2014.

The payment processing industry is made up of the traditional giants, Visa Inc and Mastercard, 
as well as agile companies derived from start-up culture like PayPal and Stripe. 
Stripe is a private company founded in 2010. The last round of funding valued the company at $35 billion in Sept 2019. 
PayPal acquired Braintree in 2015 for $800 million and previously Braintree purchased Venmo in 2012 for $ 26.2. 
Venmo is a direct competitor to Square’s smart phone application: Cash App.

When Square Inc was created, its sole purpose was payment processing and merchant services. 
It has now evolved to include small business lending and mobile payments. 
The company was also involved with food delivery as recently as 2019 but had a change of course. 
Square acquired Caviar for $90 million in 2013. 
Caviar is a mobile food ordering platform that found a niche in providing food delivery for upscale restaurants. 
Unfortunately for Square, the acquisition of Caviar did not go as intended. 
In 2019, Square announced the sale of Caviar to DoorDash for $410 million. 
At the time when the deal was announced, Sneha Nahata of MarketRealist.Com wrote, 
“Square’s decision to sell the Caviar food app came as it aims to boost its profits and concentrate on its core payment business. 
The Caviar app’s high costs hurt Square’s margins. Therefore, selling Caviar could let Square focus on restaurants and 
food sellers through a payment platform rather than delivery services.” 


### Results
---
The market size of payment processing is expected to surpass $62 billion by 2024. 
Square’s revenue for the calendar year 2019 was $4.71 billion with profits of $1.89 billion.  
The company also processed $106.24 billion in gross payment volume. According to Square Inc, 
“We define GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. 
Additionally, GPV includes Cash App activity related to peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card and Cash for Business. 
As described above, GPV excludes card payments processed for Starbucks.” 
It is interesting to view the breakdown of gross payment volume for Square. 
For the year ending December 2019, 26% of GPV was earned from food and drink merchants. 
This is followed by retail and professional services which carry 17% and 15% of GPV for the company. 
Healthcare and fitness make up 8% of company GPV. 
Considering the amount of health spending in the United States, this is an opportunity area for Square. 
Data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows
that the United States far out paces any nation in healthcare spending. 
Per Capita in U.S. dollars, America spends $10,586 and the next closest is Switzerland with $7,317. 
This shows us sheer volume of payment processing needed for healthcare and 
there is still plenty of room for Square to grow in the processing of healthcare payments.

When looking at technology companies, some of the core metrics to measure success include the liquidity ratio, 
the debt to equity ratio and gross profit margin. 
In 2019, Square Inc had current assets of $3.22 billion and current liabilities of 1.69 billion, for a quick ratio of 1.9. 
The conservative measure for liquidity uses only cash and marketable securities instead of current liabilities. 
Ending 2019, Square had cash and investments totaling $1.55 billion to give us a conservative liquidity ratio of roughly 0.92. 
For comparison, Visa had a liquidity ratio of 1.56, and a conservative liquidity ratio of 0.9 for the calendar year ending in September 2019. 
Mastercard’s liquidity and conservative liquidity ratios come to 1.42 and 0.64 respectively. 
PayPal is a competitor with a payment processing model that looks more alike Square’s own. 
The liquidity ratio for PayPal is 1.43, and conservatively that ratio shows 0.40. 
Square reported total debt of $2.84 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $1.72 billion, for a debt to equity ratio of 1.65. 
In comparison, Visa has a debt to equity ratio of 1.09, Mastercard’s is 3.93 and PayPal’s is 2.03. 
Lastly, when looking at gross profit margin, Square’s margins are at 60%. 
The margins for Visa are 65%, Mastercard is 57% and PayPal has a 15% gross profit margin. 
To be relatively new in payment processing compared to traditional companies, 
Square Inc has structured its fundamentals to perform with the efficiency of the payment processing titans. 

### Recommendations
---
Both Visa and Mastercard provide billing and payment solutions to the medical industry. 
Square Inc, using its ecosystem of software and hardware, can distinguish themselves as the differentiator in medical payment processing and merchant services. 
The next big leap for innovation after simplifying small business, would be to conquer a complex and bureaucratic industry. 

Using current infrastructure, Square can add additional applications to support the lengthy, multi-step process of medical billing. 
Healthcare providers have, in the past, completed their own billing because of the complexities of medical procedures, medical equipment and regulation. 
Providers are now outsourcing billing as their old methods become obsolete. 
According to Grand View Research, healthcare providers spent $9.3 billion on outsourcing their billing in 2019. 

Creating a healthcare billing platform adds a focus on a high-growth area that does not currently make up a large part of company revenue. 
One third of what the U.S. spends on healthcare goes toward medical billing and its administration costs. 
To enact this strategy, Square will have to rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
This will aid in the detection of medical billing and coding errors. 
Errors in medical billing and coding are estimated to be worth $750 billion a year. 

Square Inc, with its combination of payment processing and merchant services, is extending its reach in business to business services. 
Square now provides lending options to its sellers along with the software and hardware needed to track every dollar in inventory. 
It also doesn’t hurt that every dollar comes through sleek and modern “cash” registers. 
Square Inc poses as a new age company that may very well live long enough to exist in the next new age.
